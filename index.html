      <p>I am a Masterâ€™s graduate in Mathematics in Data Science from the Technical University of Munich, where I specialized in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and the Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning and Statistics. My academic journey has been guided by a strong curiosity for solving real-world problems through data-driven methods.
         I bring a particular passion for working with medical and physiological data, where I have developed a solid background in signal analysis and statistical modeling. Throughout my research and projects, I have enjoyed tackling complex challenges such as understanding biosignals, advancing motion tracking, and improving data interpretation for practical use cases.</p>
